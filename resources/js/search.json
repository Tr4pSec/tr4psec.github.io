The further left in the command you are able to filter out data, the less resources you are going to use on whatever device you are running commands on. This could be a normal endpoint, or a server.

One of the operators I recommend reading about is -Like and -Contains.","When comparing strings using these comparison operators, PowerShell does not care about upper or lower case strings.

If you don't know what an array is, it's basically a data type that contains a group of objects. You have tons of different types of objects. Don't think too hard about different object types, just know that every \"type\" of object is different. I'll show you how to check what kind of object you're dealing with.","First thing we see is the TypeName. This is basically telling you what type of object you're dealing with. A System.String object. Or just a String object for short.","If your goal was to actually change the object stored in the $Test variable, you would have to declare it again like this:","Let's try the ToUpper method:","Methods are invoked the same way, but they end with a ( ) after the method name. Some methods require input inside the ( ).","Next Get-Member lists all the Methods and Properties of the object.","Now I'm going to show you the most important command of them all:","Now if we just run $Test in our Shell, PowerShell returns \"This is a string.\".","Now listen, calling a method on a object does not change the object itself. It merely outputs a new modified version of the object. That means if you run $Test again after previously running the ToUpper method, you'll see that your string remains unchanged.","Now your $Test would look a bit different:","PowerShell is full of objects. And dealing with different types of objects is something you'll spend a lot of time doing if you want to get into PowerShell.","See what our ToUpper method did to our string?","So let's first focus on the Properties of our String Object. As you can see in the very long list above, this object only has one Property: Length. You can invoke properties by writing:","So let's pipe our $Test variable into Get-Member and see what we're dealing with:","So, every time you run a command in PowerShell, it returns an object.
